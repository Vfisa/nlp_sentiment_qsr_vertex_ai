Me and 4 friends walked in and got seated right away. Our waiter had a little bit of attitude and was completely lost, he kept interrupting us while we were ordering and when my friends little sister that is 12 years old ordered off the kid menu. He said to her ‚Äú that is only for little kids‚Äù (then looks at her) and continues to say ‚Äú but just this one time I‚Äôll let it slide‚Äù and still managed to get 3/5 of our orders wrong. After ordering it, it took them about an hour and 8 minutes to get our food even though it was lonely. My pancakes were hard and a little burnt but the steak omelette was perfectly fine. The mac and cheese with fries (kids menu item) had light flavor and pasta was still a tiny bit undercooked. The 3 sandwiches that my friends ordered but they had to remake it because they gave us the wrong sandwich. Said that the crispy chicken was very dry but other than that it was perfectly. And on top of that non of us ever got a refill on our drinks. As a worker in customer service I feel embarrassed and very disappointed with how poorly this service was.","1.0","2024-04-14 18:47:15","Negative"

They have both indoor and outdoor seating, a water feature, an appealing menu, and friendly staff.

For a Starter, we went with the Sweet & Spicy Jumbo Shrimp ($14) sauteed with roasted jalape√±os & drizzled with wildflower honey. The downside is that the shrimp still has the skin on it, so you have to peel it, but it is very sticky because of the sauce, which is not actually touching the shrimp meat.
The sauce is delicious and I love that it is sweetened with honey instead of just sugar. The shrimp itself was very chewy and possibly over cooked.

From the Grill, we went with the Skirt Steak ($23) which comes with Chimichurri Sauce and your choice of 2: White or Brown Rice, Fries & Garden Salad. The meat was tough, the chimichurri sauce was randomly too spicy, and there was not enough chimichurri.

Next time I‚Äôd come back to try their daily happy hour, which goes from 4-7pm.","4.0","2023-11-12 05:06:19","Mixed"

I am somewhat of a middle-eastern food snob as I have been eating and making it for over 50 of my 60 years and this is so very good I would be proud to say I had made it myself. A lot of ‚Äúmiddle-eastern‚Äù places serve food that is more ‚Äúinspired by‚Äù then the actual thing, and after you add in a bored line cook the recipes become very blah.
Not so here, all the items are spiced subtly but correctly, even the saffron rice which almost always tastes like rice with yellow food coloring at most places.The spicing on everything was done to perfection- subtle but prominent and easily distinguished from each other.

Rare that I give a five star, especially when I order it from a delivery service but these people have hit it out of the park. Well done, Habibi!","5.0","2024-01-27 01:36:51","Positive"

This is my first experience at this establishment and my last. I recommend everyone to avoid this place and never come here. If you do happen to come here, avoid being served by Wendy R.

**My experience:**

Upon arriving at the establishment, I approached a girl who was cleaning the floors and asked for a table. They found a table for me. After sitting down and choosing what to order from the menu, the waitress Wendy R. came to take my order. After taking my order, she immediately (10-15 seconds) brought me the check for payment, even though I hadn't even been given water yet. I suspect this waitress considered me a bad person or unable to pay. Since I was very hungry, I didn't say anything and paid silently. My mood was ruined for the rest of the day; I felt this negativity towards me.

The atmosphere is great and the space is huge. A very nice bar is the first thing I noticed when I entered.
The menu is large and the food is great for the price. Don't expect homemade tortillas, rice etc, as the tortillas are most likely straight out of the package as well as the rice, which tasted similar to Uncle Ben's packaged Spanish rice.
You can probably get away for a dinner for two for under $40 easily.

I had a bite of the mushroom quesadilla and it was SO GOOD. Also loved the nachos. My friend loved her Crepas Mexicanas.

If you‚Äôre complaining about the price for a wrap and fries maybe you shouldn‚Äôt try being cheap in Brentwood? For the same price at the same restaurant you could have purchased a huge bowl with an amazing salad+rice+meat+hummus. But no, you chose to get the fries and a sad little burrito wrap. You give poor ratings because you make bad decisions? At least complain about the food quality or how long you had to tend to your outhouse that night, not waste people‚Äôs time explaining to people how indecisive you are because you fear change and lack the patience to read the full menu.

Had shredded brisket and carnitas on soft flour today.  Best two tacos I've had in at least half a dozen visits.  Meat well seasoned AND well drained.  Not dripping or slimy tortillas.  Awesome!  Neat and well-represented as well.

Waitress was so very sweet.  She checked on me, but was not over solicitus.

The tray/trash caddy is fixed!!!  THAT is how I know they are listening, and that is great!  It was broken since shortly after store opened.

Long way to go to meet this old dining facility officer's standards, but thanks to all concerned that we appear to be headed in the right direction.  Yay again!!

UPDATE 04/16/2024:  Unfortunately, this last visit revealed that the store standards for this usually stellar Fuzzy's have slipped.  I was in around getting off work time.  There was NOT enough labor allocated to the food.  One person pulling from the kitchen AND serving out on the patio, the bar area, and the main dining room.  I waited 15 minutes for my just out of hospital wife's TO GO order.

I tried to get the attention of the owner?/manager?, but he was ""busy"" sitting at a table in the bar area with a single customer the whole time and never looked up at the restaurant activities once.

This is also the first time he was in the store while I was there in my last 6 visits.  This did not use to be the case.

Also, the kitchen staff is getting sloppy and lazy.... rolling aluminum foil not only AROUND, but DEEP into my tacos....  taco comes apart taking the wrapper off so you don't eat it.

And the chorizo is SWIMMING in its own rendered grease....  it's like no one ever heard of rendering, draining, straining, or any other method to prevent a slimy dough ball instead of a taco.

And the store is dirty.  Needs a stand-down cleaning top to bottom

Staff is NOT doing progressive or side cleaning consistently.

I suspect I could CLOSE them if I inspected the kitchen to industry standards based on my experience that back of house is always in worse shape than front of house.

TREMEDOUSLY disappointing!

I took a star away from each line.

I will remove this update IF they fix the store.  I will be calling the franchise OWNER tomorrow to see if I can get my favorite taco place back where it belongs.

Oh, and they quit having freakin' fajita tacos....  REALLY?

####### END #######

UPDATE 10/10/2023: Went in today to mark Veteran's Day and the End of the War to End All Wars.  It was all but empty with the FEDGOV holiday, but the chorizo and egg breakfast tacos were AWESOME as always!!
#############

Straight up the best tacos I have had in a long, long time.  Store is well maintained, clean, and the staff are super nice AND competent....  a combination that is hard to find in retail food anymore.

You cannot go wrong with Fuzzy's for good food at reasonable prices.

The owner/,amager, Drew, has been IN the store front of house on 2 of my 3 visits.  That is awesome....  and he remembered AND greeted me.

Get you some tacos!  Go to Fuzzy's!  Tell 'em Clay sent you!!

06/28/2023 - Nom, nom, nom....  Fuzzy's is now the ONLY fast food place at which I eat.  I am saving the money from those crazy-arsed high prices at Whataburger, Sonic, even Taco Bell and using it at Fuzzy's!

3 tacos and a giant drink in one of my special Fuzzy's cups and I am set!  Well, and some Butt Burnin' Sauce of course!

We always come to this location because it's convenient.  The food is good, but I wish the presentation was better, it's like a 2 out of 5. The servers are great, but when it gets very busy they don't really have time to attend to every table so it's understandable.

They were simply delicious and left me craving for more. The Hash Brown and Scrambled Eggs were okay.

However, there was a slight hiccup during our meal. Our server initially forgot to bring our coffee. While this could have been a disappointment, I must commend her for her immediate response. She not only acknowledged the mistake but was genuinely apologetic about it. Her willingness to rectify the situation promptly stood out. To make amends, she offered us a complimentary coffee to go, which was a thoughtful gesture.

Despite the initial coffee slip-up, I left IHOP with a positive impression, thanks to the tasty food and the server's efforts to make amends. I would certainly consider returning for another enjoyable meal.","4.0","2023-08-24 23:59:33","Positive"

* Our entree was brought without garlic bread (on the menu it goes with it)

I ordered a 4-stack with banana slices--yum! When they came, I asked our waiter, Edgar, if IHOPE had any candles. He said they didn't...but 5 minutes later he came back with a small candle that he'd found in a back room drawer.

Then I asked if he had any matches, and again he said no. But 10 minutes later he came to our table with matches--which he'd gone to his own car to get.

The customer service, food, prices, margaritas, and patio are just consistently great!

Menu highlights: the chorizo, potato, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito served all day is without question the best breakfast burrito around town (avidly searching for others with no luck!). The birria tacos are super solid (I‚Äôve had better but these are cheap and scratch the itch). The nachos with the blanco queso are fire. The smothered burritos are delicious and extremely filling.
